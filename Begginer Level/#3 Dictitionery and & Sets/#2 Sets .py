# A set is  a collection of well defined objects that can not be repeated 

s ={ 1,2,3 } #    If keys are absent in a dictionery then it becomes a set 

# As empty {} make  empty dictionery then how will we make an empty set 

e=set()   #Don't use s={}, because it makes an empty dictionery 

# Benifit of set is that data can't be repeated 

s={1,3,5,5,5,5,5}
