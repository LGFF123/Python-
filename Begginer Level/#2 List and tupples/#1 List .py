# List work same in python as array in C++
#but with some kind of differences Like it can store all kind of data types 

# List are mutable (change-able ) umlike strings , string can not be changed ,they only update 

data=["Apple","Orange",5,34.5,False,"Akash"]

print(data[0])

data[0]=23

print (data[0]) #  print 23  instead of Apple because list first index is changed to 23 in above given code

print (data[0:4]) # print list data form 0 index to 4
