# Tuple is immutable unlike to list same as string 

a=(1,2,4,5)

print (type(a))

#If you try to make a tuple of single subtance it give datat type as int not tuple 
#To remove this error make tuple in this way a=(1,) use a coma after tuple 

# List is a=[1,2,3]= Mutable 
# Tuple is a=(1,2,3) = Immutable
